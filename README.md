# Emu De Midi synthesizer
It's a software synthesizer based on SCC and OPLL made by Mitsutaka Okazaki in
2004, later maintained by Chris Moeller. This is slightly updated version which
can be built and run on Linux and macOS as well as it worked on Windows
originally.

This is a preserved and slightly updated project, no longer maintained for
a while.

**There is a NEW project called libEDMIDI, which is a direct successor of this:**
